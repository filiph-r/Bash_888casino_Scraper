<h2>Task Description:</h2>

Prepare a script that can programmatically access the data and log it to the console every 30 seconds whilst the script is running.<br>
There are many ways to access this data. One is to observe the HTML and just gather the information from within the relative tag. Whilst this is a valid option, finding the right endpoint (if feasible) and extract the data from a JSON or XML response is more complicated to work out initially but easier to maintain in the long run.<br>

<h2>Executable:</h2>

hourly_jackpot_scraper.sh file -> [here](https://github.com/filiph-r/Bash_888casino_Scraper-/blob/main/hourly_jackpot_scraper.sh)<br>
Note: command-line tools like <b>curl</b> and <b>jq</b> were used. Make sure they are installed on your system


<h2>How to use:</h2>
Download and execute the hourly_jackpot_scraper.sh file in the terminal<br>
You can also add one argument to the command that indicates how long you want to wait in between each request in seconds. <br>
If no argument is provided the default value is 30s<br><br>
Example1: ./hourly_jackpot_scraper.sh<br>
Example2: ./hourly_jackpot_scraper.sh 5<br>
(In Example2 the waiting time is 5s)<br><br>
You will also be prompted to input the desired currency.<br>
After that, the program will infinitely print out the value of the hourly jackpot in the given time intervals.<br><br>

<h2>How it's done:</h2>
<h3>Analyzing the webpage</h3>
The webpage https://www.888casino.com/jackpots/ has been analyzed and inspected. The page HTML code, as well as the network connectivity, have been inspected to identify the request that is holding the value for the »hourly jackpot«. <br>
The identified reoccurring GET request to the URL: https://feed-casino888.redtiger.cash/jackpots?jackpotId=williamHill&currency=usd <br><br>
It has been further inspected with the Insomnia REST client to analyze the data: <br><br>

One conclusion was that there are multiple currencies supported. To identify all supported currencies the first network request to the page was inspected with the page document download for the URL https://de.888casino.com/jackpots/. By searching through the response for "Currency" a list of currencies mapped to countries was found. This information was used to include only the supported currencies in this program.<br><br>
